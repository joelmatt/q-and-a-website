# q-and-a-website
--------------------------VERY FIRST PROJECT THAT INCLUDES HTML, CSS,BOOTSTRAP, a bit of PHP, a bit of  SQL and the use of XAMPP---------------------
This is a part of my college Summer Project. A very basic question answer website named as The Engineering Portal (TEP).
For engineering students for asking questions and to be answered by anyone who can answer the specific question. A VERY BASIC QUESION ANSWER PORTAL :)
# XAMPP SETUP-------------------------
Install the latest version of xampp inorder to avoid the error faced during data entry
Create a database by going the localhost/phpmyadmin. Name the database as 'loginsystem'.
The SQL code for the tables are in the files. Just copy paste and your tables will be created.
# html(bootstrap) css php------------------------
The html code includes the classes from bootstrap to make the website mobile friendly. CDN for bootstrap already included in the <head> of all pages.
Since it is my very first time coding with php html and css it is no where good enough but it performs fine.
More efforts are gone in making the UI look good.The questions and the answers are not evaluated in any way.
Font used in are from googlefonts.
Learnt creating the  home page from youtube.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIWRbvE1B2E&t=1690s). Very helpful in knowing how bootstrap worked and how to apply it in every pages i created.
Learnt to set up login/signup page using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb8aad4MRx8&t=7s.
